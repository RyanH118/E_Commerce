# E_Commerce

## Description

I was motivated in this challenge to make a back end with new technology for a E commerce website. The goal I wanted to complete was to GET all data from categories, products, and tags as well as to get single reviews. I also wanted to UPDATE and DELETE from categories, products, and tags using Insomnia to test it. I learned how to store sensitive info for my postgres login by using a dotenv file. I also learned how to use Insomnia to test my routes and see if they work and how models and routes can work together.
